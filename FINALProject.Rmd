### Load Packages
(directions say must use tidyverse, may use one more)
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

### Read in Data and Convert Stat Files to Data Frames
(i think this might be right?)
```{r}
read.csv("ProjectTeam8-4/Memorial_Fantasy.csv")
read.csv("ProjectTeam8-4/PGA_Fantasy.csv")
read.csv("ProjectTeam8-4/Schwab_Fantasy.csv")

Memorial_Stats <- read.delim("ProjectTeam8-4/Memorial_Stats.txt")
PGA_Stats <- read.delim("ProjectTeam8-4/PGA_Stats.txt")
Schwab_Stats <- read.delim("ProjectTeam8-4/Schwab_Stats.txt")
```

###Join Fantasy and Statistics to Create One Data Frame forEach of Three Tournaments
```{r}
Memorial <-

PGA <-
  
  
Schwab <-
  
```

### Combine the Three Tournament Data Frames to Final Data Frame
```{r}

```
