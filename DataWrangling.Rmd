#### Load Packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

#### Read in Data and Convert Stat Files to Data Frames
```{r}
Memorial_Fantasy <- read.csv("Memorial_Fantasy.csv") # read in Memorial_Fantasy data

names(Memorial_Fantasy) <- c("Player", "Salary", "FPTS", "Tournament", "Par") # change Name variable to Player

Memorial_Stats <- read.csv("Memorial_Stats.txt") # read in Memorial_Stats data

Memorial_Stats <- data.frame(column = c(Memorial_Stats[,]))

Memorial_Stats <- Memorial_Stats %>%
  mutate(key = rep(c("Position", "Player", "Score", "Putt", "ARG", "App", "OTT", "T2G", "Total"), n()/9), id = cumsum(key == "Position")) %>%
  spread(key, column) # long to wide transformation; transpose every 9 rows of Memorial_Stats into a column

Memorial_Stats <- subset(Memorial_Stats, select = -id)
Memorial_Stats <- Memorial_Stats[, c("Position", "Player", "Score", "Putt", "ARG", "App", "OTT", "T2G", "Total")] # reorganize columns
```

#### Join Fantasy and Statistics to Create One Data Frame for Each of Three Tournaments
```{r}
Memorial <- full_join(Memorial_Stats, Memorial_Fantasy, by = "Player")

PGA <-
  
Schwab <-

```

#### Combine the Three Tournament Data Frames to Final Data Frame 
```{r}

```
